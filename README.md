Developing an AI game player for a game called Teeko.

Teeko is very simple:

It is a game between two players on a 5x5 board. Each player has four markers of either red or black. Beginning with black, they take turns placing markers (the "drop phase") until all markers are on the board, with the goal of getting four in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or in a 2x2 box as shown above.

If after the drop phase neither player has won, they continue taking turns moving one marker at a time—to an adjacent space only!—until one player wins.
